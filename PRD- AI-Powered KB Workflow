Product Requirements Document (PRD) - AI-Powered KB Workflow
1. Introduction & Overview

The AI-Powered KB Workflow system is designed to revolutionize how knowledge base (KB) articles are created, maintained, and utilized within a support organization. It leverages multiple AI agents to automate and enhance various stages of the KB lifecycle, from drafting articles based on resolved support tickets to improving existing content and providing superior search capabilities. The system aims to reduce manual effort, improve KB quality and relevance, and ensure knowledge is easily accessible.
2. Goals & Objectives

Reduce KB Creation Time: Significantly decrease the time and effort required for support engineers to create new KB articles.
✅ Addresses: High Time Cost
Improve KB Content Quality & Relevance: Ensure KB articles are accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive.
✅ Addresses: Outdated Content
Enhance Knowledge Discoverability: Provide a natural language search experience that surfaces the most relevant KBs, going beyond simple keyword matching.
✅ Addresses: Poor Search, Fragmented Knowledge
Proactive KB Maintenance: Automatically identify and suggest improvements for outdated or incomplete KBs.
✅ Addresses: Outdated Content, Inefficient Review
Maintain Consistency & Trust: Standardize KB formatting and tagging, and ensure all AI-generated content is validated by human experts.
✅ Addresses: Tagging Inconsistencies, Maintaining Trust
Seamless Integration: Provide APIs for integration with existing support ticket systems and other enterprise tools.

3. Target Users / Audience
Support Engineers / Technical Support Staff: Primary creators, reviewers, and users of the KB system.
KB Managers / Content Curators: Responsible for the overall health, quality, and organization of the knowledge base.
End-Users (Customers/Internal Staff via Portal): Consumers of KB articles seeking self-service solutions (indirectly benefit from improved KBs and search).

4. User Stories / Features
F1: KB Creator Agent - Automated Draft Generation
US1.1: As a Support Engineer, when I resolve a support ticket, I want the system to automatically generate a draft KB article using the ticket's conversation and resolution details, so I can save time on manual KB creation.
US1.2: As a KB Manager, I want AI-generated drafts to follow a consistent structure (e.g., Problem, Environment, Steps, Cause, Solution), so KBs are standardized.
F2: KB Retriever Agent - Intelligent Search
US2.1: As a Support Engineer, I want to describe an issue in natural language and receive the most relevant KB articles, so I can quickly find solutions for customer issues.
US2.2: As a Support Engineer, I want search results to provide a snippet or summary, so I can quickly assess relevance before opening the full article.
US2.3 (Optional): As a User (via portal), I want to ask a question in natural language and receive a synthesized answer based on KB content, with links to source articles.
F3: KB Improviser Agent - Proactive Content Enhancement
US3.1: As a KB Manager, when a new ticket is resolved with information that updates or clarifies an existing KB, I want the system to suggest specific improvements to that KB, so our knowledge base stays current.
US3.2: As a Support Engineer, if I find a KB article that is outdated or incomplete during my search, I want a way to flag it so the system can suggest improvements.
US3.3: As a KB Manager, I want the system to periodically identify KBs that might be outdated based on recent support ticket trends or lack of usage, and suggest review or updates.
F4: AI Supervisor Agent - Human Validation & Quality Control
US4.1: As a Support Engineer (acting as AI Supervisor), I want a dedicated interface to review AI-generated KB drafts, edit them, add tags, and approve or reject them, so I can ensure quality and accuracy.
US4.2: As a Support Engineer (acting as AI Supervisor), I want to review AI-suggested improvements to existing KBs and approve or reject them, so I can maintain control over content changes.
US4.3: As an AI Supervisor, I want the system to learn from my corrections and approvals over time to improve the quality of its future suggestions and drafts.
F5: System Integration & Administration
US5.1: As a System Administrator, I want the AI KB Workflow to expose APIs, so it can be integrated with our existing support ticket platform and other internal tools.
US5.2: As a KB Manager, I want basic analytics on KB creation, usage, and search effectiveness, so I can understand the system's impact.


5. Success Metrics
Efficiency:
Average time to create and publish a new KB article (Target: X% reduction).
Number of KBs drafted by AI vs. manually per week/month.
Quality & Relevance:
KB utilization rate (views/searches leading to resolution).
User ratings/feedback on KB article helpfulness.
Percentage of AI-drafted KBs approved without major edits.
Discoverability:
Search success rate (user finds relevant KB in top N results).
Reduction in duplicate support tickets for issues already covered by KBs.
Adoption & Satisfaction:
Active users of the supervisor interface.
Satisfaction scores from Support Engineers regarding the AI assistance.


6. Assumptions & Constraints
Assumptions:
Access to a reliable and capable Large Language Model (LLM) service (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or a sufficiently powerful self-hosted model).
Resolved support tickets contain sufficient detail (conversation, resolution steps) for meaningful KB draft generation.
Support Engineers are willing to adopt and train the AI by providing feedback.
Constraints:
Initial development will use Python and Gradio as specified.
The system must be able to integrate with a generic ticket system via API/webhook or data export.
Data privacy and security must be considered, especially when processing ticket information.


7. Out of Scope (Future Considerations)
Fully autonomous KB publishing without human review.
Advanced predictive analytics for identifying knowledge gaps before tickets arise.
Multi-language support beyond English (initially).
Visual content generation (diagrams, screenshots) for KBs.
Direct customer-facing AI chatbot for KB retrieval (initial focus is internal support).
