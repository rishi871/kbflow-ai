# Placeholder for KB Improviser Agent
# This agent is more complex and would involve:
# - Comparing new info (e.g., a new ticket, user feedback) with an existing KB.
# - Using an LLM to suggest specific changes.
# - Storing these suggestions for supervisor review.

def suggest_kb_improvements(kb_id: str, new_information: str):
    # 1. Fetch existing KB content for kb_id
    # 2. Construct a prompt for an LLM:
    #    "Given this existing KB article: [KB_content]
    #     And this new information: [new_information]
    #     Suggest specific improvements or additions to the KB article.
    #     Output changes in a diff-like format or as specific instructions."
    # 3. Call LLM
    # 4. Parse suggestions
    # 5. Store suggestions linked to kb_id
